						Who we are
					</h2>
					<p class="text-left">
						YindaYin Coaching is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization registered in the State of New York. “YindaYin” literally
						translates to “yes, of course!” in the Tibetan language. YindaYin Coaching is the result of countless discussions
						between founders Chime Dolma and Tashi Tenzin. Influenced by their own experience as educators, they are
						passionate about empowering young people through education and mentorship. YindaYin Coaching is open to all
						families living in New York City, but it has its roots in serving the immigrant community of Queens.
					</p>
					<p class="text-left">
						As immigrants themselves, the founders have worked closely with Tibetan immigrants and refugees in Queens and
						have therefore witnessed the hardships they face. They hope to provide a platform that can help children of
						immigrant families take full advantage of the opportunities that the educational system offers in America. That
						is why YindaYin Coaching Center is strategically located in Jackson Heights, a subsection of Queens with one of
						the densest Tibetan populations as well as a diverse population of other immigrant communities. We encourage our
						students to embrace the diversity of their community and learn to respect people from all backgrounds. Fostering
						diversity and compassion in our future generation is a key element of our program equal to achieving academic
						excellence.

								1. Tibetan
							</h4>
						</div>
						<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingOne">
							<div class="panel-body">
								Language is more than just a means of communication. It holds the power to carry on traditions and values.
								Tibetan philosophical and scientific theories have been the recent focus of studies conducted by some of the
								world’s leading scholars, and there are a number of conferences and literature dedicated to this field.
								Although the Tibetan language is spoken by millions of people across the world, in recent years, it has faced
								the threat of extinction. Therefore, we believe the further study of Tibet’s culture and tradition will depend
								on the preservation of the language in the next generation. With hands-on learning pedagogy, our goal is to
								provide resources to all students, regardless of their proficiency in Tibetan. We want to make learning Tibetan
								language more immersive, personalized, accessible and fun for children of all age groups.

								2. English
								</a>
							</h4>
						</div>
						<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingTwo">
							<div class="panel-body">
								Our English program takes a multifaceted approach to our English class, focusing on not only writing and
								reading, but also critical thinking and research skills that are necessary to succeed in the 21st century. We
								at YindaYin Coaching have also created tools for parents and children of all ages, including creating bedtime
								reading recordings for young children, teaching students our strategies and tips for research and academic
								writing, and tailored college readiness courses.

								3. Chinese
							</h4>
						</div>
						<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree">
							<div class="panel-body">
								Nowadays, an extra language skill can be a highly marketable skill both in the college and job search. China
								has become the 2nd largest economy in the world, and more and more employers are seeking applicants with
								Mandarin Chinese skills. That is why we at YindaYin Coaching provide Chinese immersion class to children as
								young as two years old. Our Chinese immersion classes are taught entirely by native Chinese speakers. </div>

				<div class="program-section">
					<h3 class="subtitle">Math Classes</h3>
					<p>According to Washington Post, Pew Research Center and other sources, the level of math and science literacy in
						America has fallen behind many developing countries. YindaYin Coaching is committed to reverse this trend,
						particularly in the underserved communities. We coach young children to incubate an early interest in math by
						playing number games, such as categorizing shapes and measuring objects in our daily lives. We also provide
						customized math tutoring services to older student to help them succeed in their coursework and standardized
						tests, such as middle/high school Math, New SAT, ACT,and ELA (including Common Core and Regents preparations) .
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="program-section">
					<h3 class="subtitle">Gifted & Talented</h3>
					<p>Gifted & Talented (G&T) programs are one way that New York City supports the educational needs of exceptional
						students. The G&T exam determines eligibility for covered seats in an NYC gifted and talented school or program.
						We provide specialized one-on-one exam preparation for all age groups from November to January.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="program-section">
					<h3 class="subtitle">After School Program</h3>
					<p>YindaYin Coaching’s After School Program provides one-on-one homework assistance and tutoring sessions for 1st
						-8th grade students. The After School Program is led by experienced college graduate instructors with tutoring
						experience from Monday through Friday. Our afterschool program includes a wide range of educational, cultural,
						artistic, and fun activities, with the primary focus to assist children with homework and their academic growth.

					<h3 class="subtitle">Leadership Program</h3>
					<p>We make decisions everyday, from the life-changing to the mundane. But many of the decisions we make can have a
						cumulative impact on our future, especially for young children. At YindaYin Coaching, we encourage children to be
						smart and independent decision makers . From a young age, we teach our students to work both on their own and in
						teams. For instance, we always let them to pick their snacks, seats, games, outdoor activities, group leaders,
						and even create their own class policies. We carry out our leadership practices throughout all of our programs.
						We not only focus on the students, but also provide leadership trainings to our coaches, interns, volunteers and
						parents by listening to their suggestions, providing them with resources and letting them lead initiatives that
						they care the most about. We believe these efforts help students and our larger YindaYin family make wise
						decisions that are not only advantageous to themselves, but that also have a positive impact for society. </p>

				<div class="program-section">
					<h3 class="subtitle">Mentorship</h3>
					<p>A great mentor can help set the right path for young people. That is why we deeply value and appreciate those
						who contribute to our mentorship program. Each student in YindaYin Coaching’s College Preparation Program is
						matched with a mentor who shares similar interests. Mentors not only guide students in their college
						applications, but are also share their own life experience and invaluable advice. Our mentors are college and
						masters graduates from a variety of educational fields and working in a different sectors. Please click here to
						learn more about our past and current mentors and mentees: <a href="#contact">Contact Us Section</a> and <a href="#team">Our
							Coaches</a></p>
				</div>

				<div class="program-section">
					<h3 class="subtitle">SAT Class</h3>
					<p>It is a fact that a good SAT score is one of the most critical components of the college application. YindaYin
						Coaching provides well trained SAT coaches and the latest study materials to help students succeed. We focus on
						test taking strategies to help students move through the problems quickly and efficiently. We also take a
						targeted and personalized approach to our SAT coaching, working with each individual student to identify his or
						her weaknesses and strategies that can help them overcome these barriers to a higher score. At YindaYin Coaching,
						students will review all the important topics covered in the SAT, and will take a number of practice tests to
						make sure they are well prepared before the actual test. We also guide students through the registration process.</p>

				<div class="program-section">
					<h3 class="subtitle">College Application Class</h3>
					<p>Unlike many countries in the world, the U.S. college admissions process is a complex and time consuming task
						that can be overwhelming for students, particularly for those whose parents cannot offer guidance because they
						themselves have not gone through the process. YindaYin Coaching has been filling this vacuum by offering college
						preparation classes for high school juniors and rising seniors. Our courses include year-round courses in SAT
						Practice and College Application Navigation.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="program-section">
					<h3 class="subtitle">Workshop and Events</h3>
					<p>YindaYin Coaching organizes weekly events, such as workshops for parents on navigating the educational system,
						and a social event called “Kick Back Fridays” where we invite guest speakers, organize Tibetan song and dance
						get-togethers, and teach middle and high school students public speaking and entrepreneurship skills.</p>
