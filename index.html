						Who we are
					</h2>
					<p class="text-left">
						YindaYin Coaching is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization registered in the State of New York. “YindaYin” literally
						translates to “yes, of course!” in the Tibetan language. YindaYin Coaching is the result of countless discussions
						between founders Chime Dolma and Tashi Tenzin. Influenced by their own experience as educators, they are
						passionate about empowering young people through education and mentorship. YindaYin Coaching is open to all
						families living in New York City, but it has its roots in serving the immigrant community of Queens.
					</p>
					<p class="text-left">
						As immigrants themselves, the founders have worked closely with Tibetan immigrants and refugees in Queens and
						have therefore witnessed the hardships they face. They hope to provide a platform that can help children of
						immigrant families take full advantage of the opportunities that the educational system offers in America. That
						is why YindaYin Coaching Center is strategically located in Jackson Heights, a subsection of Queens with one of
						the densest Tibetan populations as well as a diverse population of other immigrant communities. We encourage our
						students to embrace the diversity of their community and learn to respect people from all backgrounds. Fostering
						diversity and compassion in our future generation is a key element of our program equal to achieving academic
						excellence.

								Language is more than just a means of communication. It holds the power to carry on traditions and values.
								Tibetan philosophical and scientific theories have been the recent focus of studies conducted by some of the
								world’s leading scholars, and there are a number of conferences and literature dedicated to this field.
								Although the Tibetan language is spoken by millions of people across the world, in recent years, it has faced
								the threat of extinction. Therefore, we believe the further study of Tibet’s culture and tradition will depend
								on the preservation of the language in the next generation. With hands-on learning pedagogy, our goal is to
								provide resources to all students, regardless of their proficiency in Tibetan. We want to make learning Tibetan
								language more immersive, personalized, accessible and fun for children of all age groups.

								Our English program takes a multifaceted approach to our English class, focusing on not only writing and

								reading recordings for young children, teaching students our strategies and tips for research and academic
								writing, and tailored college readiness courses.

								Nowadays, an extra language skill can be a highly marketable skill both in the college and job search. China

								According to Washington Post, Pew Research Center and other sources, the level of math and science literacy in
								America has fallen behind many developing countries. YindaYin Coaching is committed to reverse this trend,
								particularly in the underserved communities. We coach young children to incubate an early interest in math by
								playing number games, such as categorizing shapes and measuring objects in our daily lives. We also provide
								customized math tutoring services to older student to help them succeed in their coursework and standardized
								tests, such as middle/high school Math, New SAT, ACT,and ELA (including Common Core and Regents preparations).

								We make decisions everyday, from the life-changing to the mundane. But many of the decisions we make can have a
								cumulative impact on our future, especially for young children. At YindaYin Coaching, we encourage children to
								be
								smart and independent decision makers . From a young age, we teach our students to work both on their own and
								in
								teams. For instance, we always let them to pick their snacks, seats, games, outdoor activities, group leaders,
								and even create their own class policies. We carry out our leadership practices throughout all of our programs.
								We not only focus on the students, but also provide leadership trainings to our coaches, interns, volunteers
								and
								parents by listening to their suggestions, providing them with resources and letting them lead initiatives that
								they care the most about. We believe these efforts help students and our larger YindaYin family make wise
								decisions that are not only advantageous to themselves, but that also have a positive impact for society.

						Lead SAT and Math Instructor: Polly Cost
					</h4>
					<p>
						Polly teaches common core math to the middle school and regents level math to the high school students.  Outside of YindaYin Coaching, Cost is a Senior Math Specialist with the New York Early Childhood Professional Development Institute (NYECPDI) where she teaches a course to help teachers pass their NYSTCE where she is solely responsible to create the curriculum as well.  Prior to working for NYECPDI, she has worked as a high school math teacher for the Department of Education and also taught at LaGuardia Community college using a completely student-centered and inquiry-based curriculum called CUNY Start.  She has over two decades of tutoring experience, and of those years, she spent 7 of them preparing students for the SAT exams.  One of her passions is to help others think critically and to reason aloud quantitatively.  One of her main tasks here at Yindayin Coaching is to help students find their voice, to support them to confidently assert their needs, and to encourage others.  By bolstering these young learners, Cost hopes that she can motivate them to take small steps for positive change, and show them how they can further help their classmates, their friends, and their family, thereby supporting their community and beyond.
